      <p>
        Launching a rocket isn't our only goal. We also need to get it back in
        one piece. Recovery is responsible for returning our rocket safely to
        the ground. This subteam designs and builds parachutes, pyrotechnic
        fasteners, and parachute ejection systems. Recovery also designs testing
        rigs and performs tests of our unique inverted-reefed parachute and itâ€™s
        deployment systems.

      <p>On the recovery team, you could be working on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designing parachute deployment mechanisms</li>
        <li>Designing and sewing novel parachutes</li>
        <li>Designing and building test equipment</li>
        <li>
          Leading/participating in many, many tests (hands-on and super fun!)
        </li>
      </ul>
