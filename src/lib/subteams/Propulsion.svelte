        The beginnings of rocketry are synonymous with the beginnings of rocket
        engines: devices that abuse Newton's third to move things around. The
        propulsion subteam works to build the next generation of uORocketry's
        hybrid rocket engines - which will be used to compete at SA CUP and
        beyond.
      </p>
      <p>On the propulsion team, you could be working on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design, develop, and analyse the hybrid engine</li>
        <li>Design and select feed/valving/tanks</li>
        <li>Optimize and manufacture fuel</li>
        <li>Design test equipment</li>
      </ul>
