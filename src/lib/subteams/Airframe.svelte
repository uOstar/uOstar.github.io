        An engineer knows how to design and manufacture a part. Thatâ€™s what we
        do!! Airframe is responsible for designing and manufacturing the
        internal rocket structure. This subteam also runs simulations and
        analyzes structural parts. The subteam specializes in Solidworks and
        Ansys, and maintains the CAD. If you are interested in mechanical
        design, this subteam is the one!!
      </p>
      <p>On the Airframe team, you could be working on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designing the internal the rocket</li>
        <li>
          Running different simulations (Structural, Topology, Thermal, etc.)
          using ANSYS and SOLIDWORKS to ensure the designs work!
        </li>
        <li>Designing tubes and nosecones using composite analysis</li>
        <li>
          Working with other subteams to make sure they fit inside the rocket :)
        </li>
        <li>Machining parts and fabricating the rocket</li>
        <li>
          Contacting vendors to ensure the proper manufacturing of different
          parts
        </li>
        <li>BEING COOL!</li>
      </ul>
