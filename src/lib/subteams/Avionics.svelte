        If it’s a circuit or a line of code, it’s avionics. This subteam handles
        the design and implementation of our flight computer, printed circuit
        board design, code, and all of the telecommunications between the ground
        and the rocket. The team also develops testing electronics for the other
        subteams to facilitate their testing.
