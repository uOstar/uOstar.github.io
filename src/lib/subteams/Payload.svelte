        What's the point of a rocket if you don't put anything cool inside?
        Well, payload is dealing with that problem. Our past projects include
        hemolyzing blood to assist with the Marrow project, attempting to create
        a rocket-launched drone as well as participating in the Canada Reduced
        Gravity Experiment (CAN-RGX) to investigate the effect of microgravity
        on the antibiotic resistance of E. Coli. Basically, if you can think of
        something really cool to put on the rocket, we will.
