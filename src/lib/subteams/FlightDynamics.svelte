        The goal of Flight Dynamics is to use math to predict reality. This
        subteam works on creating software models of rocket components and using
        these models to simulate the rocket's flight. The aim of this is to help
        with anything from predicting landing locations to optimizing our rocket
        engine.

      <p>On the Flight Dynamics team you could be working on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating MATLAB models to predict the flight of our rocket</li>
        <li>
          Creating MATLAB models to predict the combustion processes in our
          engine
        </li>
        <li>Integrating experimental data into our models</li>
        <li>Using simulation data to optimize our rocket</li>
